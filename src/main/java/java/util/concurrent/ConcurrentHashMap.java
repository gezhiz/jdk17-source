/**
 * A hash table supporting full concurrency of retrievals and
 * adjustable expected concurrency for updates. This class obeys the
 * same functional specification as {@link java.util.Hashtable}, and
 * includes versions of methods corresponding to each method of
 * <tt>Hashtable</tt>. However, even though all operations are
 * thread-safe, retrieval operations do <em>not</em> entail locking,
 * and there is <em>not</em> any support for locking the entire table
 * in a way that prevents all access.  This class is fully
 * interoperable with <tt>Hashtable</tt> in programs that rely on its
 * thread safety but not on its synchronization details.
 *
 * <p> Retrieval operations (including <tt>get</tt>) generally do not
 * block, so may overlap with update operations (including
 * <tt>put</tt> and <tt>remove</tt>). Retrievals reflect the results
 * of the most recently <em>completed</em> update operations holding
 * upon their onset.  For aggregate operations such as <tt>putAll</tt>
 * and <tt>clear</tt>, concurrent retrievals may reflect insertion or
 * removal of only some entries.  Similarly, Iterators and
 * Enumerations return elements reflecting the state of the hash table
 * at some point at or since the creation of the iterator/enumeration.
 * They do <em>not</em> throw {@link ConcurrentModificationException}.
 * However, iterators are designed to be used by only one thread at a time.
 *
 * <p> The allowed concurrency among update operations is guided by
 * the optional <tt>concurrencyLevel</tt> constructor argument
 * (default <tt>16</tt>), which is used as a hint for internal sizing.  The
 * table is internally partitioned to try to permit the indicated
 * number of concurrent updates without contention. Because placement
 * in hash tables is essentially random, the actual concurrency will
 * vary.  Ideally, you should choose a value to accommodate as many
 * threads as will ever concurrently modify the table. Using a
 * significantly higher value than you need can waste space and time,
 * and a significantly lower value can lead to thread contention. But
 * overestimates and underestimates within an order of magnitude do
 * not usually have much noticeable impact. A value of one is
 * appropriate when it is known that only one thread will modify and
 * all others will only read. Also, resizing this or any other kind of
 * hash table is a relatively slow operation, so, when possible, it is
 * a good idea to provide estimates of expected table sizes in
 * constructors.
 *
 * <p>This class and its views and iterators implement all of the
 * <em>optional</em> methods of the {@link Map} and {@link Iterator}
 * interfaces.
 *
 * <p> Like {@link Hashtable} but unlike {@link HashMap}, this class
 * does <em>not</em> allow <tt>null</tt> to be used as a key or value.
 *
 * <p>This class is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">

     * The basic strategy is to subdivide the table among Segments,
     * each of which itself is a concurrently readable hash table.  To
     * reduce footprint, all but one segments are constructed only
     * when first needed (see ensureSegment). To maintain visibility
     * in the presence of lazy construction, accesses to segments as
     * well as elements of segment's table must use volatile access,
     * which is done via Unsafe within methods segmentAt etc
     * below. These provide the functionality of AtomicReferenceArrays
     * but reduce the levels of indirection. Additionally,
     * volatile-writes of table elements and entry "next" fields
     * within locked operations use the cheaper "lazySet" forms of
     * writes (via putOrderedObject) because these writes are always
     * followed by lock releases that maintain sequential consistency
     * of table updates.
     *
     * Historical note: The previous version of this class relied
     * heavily on "final" fields, which avoided some volatile reads at
     * the expense of a large initial footprint.  Some remnants of
     * that design (including forced construction of segment 0) exist
     * to ensure serialization compatibility.

                        假设原来table的大小是2^k大小，那么现在新table的大小是2^(k+1)大小。而获取序号的方式是
                        int idx = e.hash & sizeMask;
                        而sizeMask = newTable.length - 1  即sizeMask = 11...1，即全是1，共k个1。
                        获取序号的算法是用元素的hash值与sizeMask做与的操作。这样得到的idx实际上就是元素的
                        hashcode值的低k位的值。而原table的sizeMask也全是1的二进制，不过总共是k-1位。
                        那么原table的idx就是元素的hashcode的低k-1位的值。所以说如果元素的hashcode的第k为如果是0，
                        那么元素在新桶的序号就是和原桶的序号是相等的。如果第k位的值是1，那么元素在新桶的序号就是 原桶的序号+(2^k-1)。
                        所以说只可能是这两个值，对于所有元素都是有对应的两个位置，所以不会发生碰撞。那么下面的那个newTable[idx] = e;就没问题了，newTable中新序号处此时肯定是空的。
